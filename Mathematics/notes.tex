    \subsection{Angle Sum and Difference}
    $$\sin(A \pm B) = \sin A \cos B \pm \cos A \sin B$$
    $$\cos(A \pm B) = \cos A \cos B \pm \sin A \sin B$$

    \subsection{Double Angle Identities}
    Double angle identities are derived from the angle and sum difference equations. 

    We know that
    $$\sin(2x) = 2\sin(x)\cos(x)$$
    therefore, we can say that
    $$\sin(4x) = 4\sin^2(x)\cos^2(x)$$

    \subsection{Euler's Form}
    We know that
    $$\sin^\theta + \cos^2\theta = 1$$
    We also know the famous equation known as Euler's formula. The imaginary number one. With the pi. No, not the one with polyhedrons. To be more precise, we mean Euler's identity. The "beautiful" equation.
    $$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$$

    Therefore, we can then conclude that:
    $$e^{i\theta} + \sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta = 0$$
