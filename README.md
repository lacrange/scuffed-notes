# (Intentionally) Scuffed Notes

## Why?
Why not?

## But actually, why?
With intentionally scuffed notes, you have to identify what things are wrong and what ones are correct. Can you spot them all?
Some will be easy, while others may be hard. But do not fret, this is meant to be a fun learning experience!

## So what's included?
So far, we have mathematics notes, though we may look to add other subject fields such as physics or chemistry.

## Can I add something?
Sure, just make a pull request and we'll review it.
